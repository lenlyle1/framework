<h1>I feel like smoking is my problem and I don’t want to ask my family to help me quit</h1>
<p>If at all possible, don’t go it alone with smoking cessation! Tell your family, friends, and co-workers that you are trying to quit and ask them for their support. Their encouragement can make a difference. You may also want to join a support group or talk to a counselor. Combining behavioral therapy with nicotine replacement products and/or medication can increase your odds of success.</p>
