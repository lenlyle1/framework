    <p>Fried foods are high in fat — and typically high in “bad” (saturated) fat. The good news is that there are many ways to decrease the amount of fried foods you eat every day without giving up the tastiness! There are several ways to substitute a healthier alternative, change your cooking methods, and make better choices at restaurants.</p>

    <p>Following is a list of healthful alternatives to fried foods:</p>

    <h5>Tips for modifying fried recipes prepared at home</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Try baking instead of frying. Baked fries are great substitutes for fried potatoes. Other low-fat cooking methods to try (and remember to add low-salt seasonings!):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Broil</li>
                <li>Microwave</li>
                <li>Roast—for vegetables and/or chicken without skin</li>
                <li>Steam</li>
                <li>Lightly stir-fry or sauté in cooking spray, small amounts of vegetable oil, or reduced sodium broth</li>
                <li>Grill seafood, chicken, or vegetables</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>It may be tempting to add bacon to sandwiches and salads for extra flavor, but bacon has very few nutrients and is high in saturated fat and calories. Instead, try making sandwiches with extra pickles, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, or mustard to add flavor without the fat.</li>
        <li>Blot all fried or greasy foods on paper towels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Alternative to fried foods at restaurants</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Make careful menu selections:</b></p>
            <p>Pay attention to the descriptions on the menu. Dishes labeled deep-fried, pan-fried, basted, batter-dipped, or breaded are probably fried. Look for dishes that say baked, steamed, roasted, grilled, or broiled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Special order:</b></p>
            <p>Many menu items would be healthy if it weren't for the way they were prepared. If the menu item says the food is fried or cooked in oil or butter, ask to have it broiled or steamed.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
