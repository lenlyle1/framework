<h1>I will cut out one high fat or high sugar food in my diet</h1>

    <p>Small changes can be powerful ways to make short-term changes and sustain them over time. When you make small changes you are moving toward your goal. Also achieving and sustaining small changes helps to motivate you to keep going. Here are some tips to help you cut out one high fat or high sugary food in your diet.</p>

    <p><strong>The first step</strong> is to identify one high fat or high sugar food that you want to cut out each day. For example, you could choose potato chips as the high fat food to eliminate each day. By cutting out an 8-oz. bag of potato chips each day, you will be saving about 160 calories each day and 1,120 calories each week — that equates to weight loss of almost ½ lb.! Following are some examples of high fat and high sugar foods to cut out and the calorie savings:</p>

                <th>Food &amp; Amount</th>
                <th>Calories Saved Each Day by Eliminating</th>
                <th>Calories Saved Each Week by Eliminating</th>
                <th>Approximate Weight Loss</th>
            </tr>

                <td>French Fries medium (4 oz.)</td>
                <td>380</td>

                <td>3/4 lb.</td>

                <td>1,239</td>
                <td>1/2 lb.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Candy bar (1.5 oz)</td>

    <p><strong>The next step</strong> is to keep track of your success (see <em>Monitoring My Progress</em> for tracking resources).</p>

    <p><strong>The last step</strong> is to reward yourself when you achieve your weekly goal — non-food reward of course!</p>

    <p>Another option is to choose lower fat varieties or switching out high fat toppings with lower fat options. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try low fat ice cream or frozen yogurt.</li>
        <li>Top a baked potato with salsa or cottage cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake foods, in place of frying.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Baked french fries are a great alternative for traditional fries.</li>
            <li>Pretzels are as salty and crunchy as potato chips, but have much less fat.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bake or broil lean cuts of meats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Go natural; it is the easiest way to avoid high sugar foods. Fruit is sweet and is delicious eaten alone or paired with other foods.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try eating a banana a different way each time. They are great with peanut butter and pretzels or in plain yogurt and granola parfaits.</li>
        <li>Pineapples have a sweet kick! Eat them fresh, canned or frozen year round. They are great in salsas and smoothies as well.</li>
        <li>Have frozen grapes on hand for snacking on hot days.</li>
        <li>On cold days, baked apples with cinnamon are sure to please.</li>
    </ul>
