    <h4 class="h3">Fresh Fruit & Vegetables can be expensive</h4>

    While it’s true you could spend a lot on certain kinds or brands of foods, you can actually meet your goals to eat more fruits & vegetables without straining your budget. Frozen tropical fruits, such as mango and pineapple, are a great value, and they actually work better for smoothies and baking than fresh. Frozen fruit has the same amount of nutrients, if not more, because freezing preserves them. Frozen vegetables may be less expensive than some fresh. Visit farmers markets for great variety and often great prices. Look for specials and coupons for fruits & vegetables when they are on sale, buy extra to put in the freezer.

    Many fruit choices are inexpensive, especially when they are in season. Watch for what is seasonal in your newspaper’s food section.
