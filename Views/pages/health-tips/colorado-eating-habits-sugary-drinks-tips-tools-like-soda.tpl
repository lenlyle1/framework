    <h4 class="h3">I like to have a soda or lemonade when we go out to eat</h4>

    <p>If you only go out to eat once or twice a week, then having a soda or lemonade can easily fit into the recommendations for sugared beverage intake. However, beware of your server continually refilling your glass! Limit yourself to just one glass of your favorite sugared beverage. If you go out to eat several times each week, consider sugar-free options, such as diet soda or unsweetened ice tea.</p>
