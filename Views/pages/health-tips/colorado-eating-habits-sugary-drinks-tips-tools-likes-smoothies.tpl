    <h4 class="h3">My family really likes smoothies — aren’t these healthful?</h4>

    <p>Many smoothies, especially the ones made at home, are prepared without any added sugar as the fruit is naturally sweet. However, many commercially made smoothies have added sugar and can have over 500 calories in the larger sizes! Choose the small size and ask your server to forgo adding any extra sweeteners.</p>
