<h1>I will increase my daily physical activity</h1>
    <p>To lose weight, you must expend more calories than you eat. One of the best ways to burn calories is to be physically active! Using or burning calories involves both the work of your activities of daily living (ADLs) and exercise.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>ADLs may include washing the car, gardening, raking leaves, washing dishes, vacuuming, etc. These activities help maintain strength and burn calories.</li>
        <li>Exercise includes activities specifically geared toward a purpose, usually to improve cardiovascular fitness, strength, flexibility, or balance and agility.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Some types of physical activity are especially beneficial for weight loss and overall health:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Aerobic activities make you breathe harder and make your heart beat faster. Aerobic activities can be moderate or vigorous in their intensity. Vigorous activities take more effort than moderate ones. For moderate activities, you can talk while you do them, but you can't sing. For vigorous activities, you can only say a few words without stopping to catch your breath.</li>
        <li>Muscle-strengthening activities make your muscles stronger. These include activities like push-ups and lifting weights. It is important to work all the different parts of the body - your legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.</li>
        <li>Bone-strengthening activities make your bones stronger. Bone strengthening activities, like jumping, are especially important for children and adolescents. These activities produce a force on the bones that promotes bone growth and strength.</li>
        <li>Balance and stretching activities enhance physical stability and flexibility, which reduces risk of injuries. Examples are gentle stretching, dancing, yoga, martial arts, and t'ai chi.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>How much physical activity do you need to do to lose weight?</strong>
    <p>The Surgeon General recommends engaging in at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most days of the week (4-5 days) to improve your health. For weight loss, the recommendations are similar, although being active for 5-6 days each week can help you to achieve your weight loss goals. Regular physical activity is even more important once you have lost weight and want to maintain your hard-earned weight loss.</p>

    <h3>How many calories does physical activity use?</h3>

    <p>A 154-pound man (5' 10") will use up about the number of calories listed doing each activity below. <strong>Those who weigh more will use more calories, and those who weigh less will use fewer.</strong> The calorie values listed include both calories used by the activity and the calories used for normal body functioning.</p>
