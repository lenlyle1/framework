<h1>I don’t have enough time to work out</h1>

	<h3>Schedule an appointment with yourself to exercise, and keep it</h3>
	<p>If you are waiting for spare time to materialize, you will probably never get around to exercising. Schedule a time in your calendar for physical activity!</p>


	<h3>Slip in more exercise</h3>
	<p>This is easy…walk more. If you live in a city or pedestrian-friendly suburb, use the shops and landmarks in your area as end points. Pick the shop that is farthest from home.</p>


	<h3>Fit in shorter exercise sessions throughout your day</h3>
	<p>You are busy, for sure. But the time is there. If you work a 50-hour week, and you sleep eight hours, that leaves 62 hours for other things. To find pockets of unused time, keep a 24-hour log of one weekday and one weekend day. You will quickly see where you can slip in mini chunks of exercise. Most people find they can take a 30-minute walk over the lunch hour. This may mean waking up early to walk, walking at lunch, or doing it right after work. You can reap the same benefits of one long workout by breaking up physical activity into smaller blocks throughout the day.</p>


	<h3>Find some “No Time Spent” ways to increase daily activity!</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Put away the remote control—get up to change the TV channel. Stretch during commercial breaks.</li>
		<li>Walk around the house while you talk on the phone.</li>
		<li>Take more steps by parking the car farther away from stores, movies theater, or your office.</li>
		<li>Get off the bus or subway one stop early and walk the rest of the way, if it is safe.</li>
	</ul>
