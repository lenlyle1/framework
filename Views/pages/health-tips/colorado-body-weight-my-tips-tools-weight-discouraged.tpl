<h1>I feel like I have so much weight to lose and I get discouraged even getting started</h1>
<p>Keep in mind that even small amounts of weight loss can help to improve your overall health, including your blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, and your blood sugar levels if you have diabetes. First, set a realistic weight loss goal of 5-10% of your body weight (i.e. if you weigh 250 lbs. 5% is about 12 lbs; 10% is 25 lbs.). Experts recommend losing 1-2 lbs. per week through decreasing your calories by about 250-300 calories each day and increasing how much energy you expend (physical activity) to about 250 calories per day (about 30 minutes of brisk walking).</p>
