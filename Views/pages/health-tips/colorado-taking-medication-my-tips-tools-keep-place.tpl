<h1>I will keep my medications in a place where I can remember to take them</h1>

    <p>Many people find it helpful to put their medications close to something that they do every day. For example, if you drink coffee every morning, you can place your medications next to the coffee pot. Some people find it helpful to put their medications next to their toothbrush (note caution below about heat and humidity in the bathroom). If you need to take your medications with a meal, you may find it helpful to keep your medications near the kitchen table or the place where you typically eat your meals.</p>

    <h3>Find a cool, dry area</h3>
    <p>You’ll want to store your medicine in an area that is convenient, but is also cool and dry — since heat and humidity can damage medicines. That’s why a bathroom is not a good place to keep your medicines unless you are able to keep the room well ventilated.</p>

    <h3>Be smart…and safe</h3>
    <p>Here are some other suggestions that can help you be smarter about storing and using your medicines.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Keep your medicines separate from those of your spouse or other family members (for instance, on a different shelf or at least on a separate side of a shelf). This will make it less likely that you take the wrong ones by mistake.</li>
        <li>You may find it helpful to have a countertop or tabletop near where you keep your medicine so you can open the bottle with it resting on the flat surface. In case you drop your pill, it will land on the tabletop and not be lost down the drain or on the floor. (But be sure not to leave your medicine bottles out on the counter afterwards.)</li>
        <li>Good lighting near where you store your medicines will help you make sure you are taking the right medicine. Never take medicines in the dark.</li>
        <li>Keep the medicine in the bottle it came in. The amber color protects the medicine from light. You will also have the information right there about what the medicine is and how often to take it. The label will also have the phone number of the pharmacy so you can call when it is time for a refill.</li>
        <li>Never mix different medicines in the same bottle. You might end up taking the wrong one by mistake. It is also possible that some of one medicine could rub off on another and affect</li>
        <li>how well it works.</li>
        <li>Keep the lids on your pill bottles tightly closed. A cap can’t be childproof if it’s not fastened correctly.</li>
        <li>If there is cotton in the pill bottle when you first open it, remove the cotton and throw it away. The cotton can absorb moisture and affect the medicine that is inside.</li>
    </ul>
