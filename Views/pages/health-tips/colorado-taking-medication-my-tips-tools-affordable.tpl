<h1>I will work with my health care team to make my medications more affordable</h1>
 
<p>It is important to talk to your doctor about the need to explore another drug because of cost. He or she may be able to substitute a less expensive medicine, perhaps a generic that will work just as well. They may also be able to tell you if the pharmaceutical company that produces it has assistance plans.</p>

<h3>What are PAPs?</h3>

<p>Prescription Assistance Programs, or PAPs, have emerged in an effort to help patients who lack health insurance or prescription drug coverage obtain the medications they need. These programs are typically offered by pharmaceutical companies to provide free or low cost prescription drugs to qualifying individuals. Millions of Americans use PAPs to get the medicines they need but can't afford. PAPs are also called patient assistance programs or medication assistance programs.</p>

<p>By providing financial assistance for hundreds of medications, PAPs provide a valuable resource to patients, helping them comply with recommended drug regimens and, in turn, obtain better health outcomes.</p>

<h3>Other Discount Programs to Help Cut Costs</h3>
<p>Together Rx Access is one of the newest prescription savings programs for eligible individuals and families. The Together Rx Access Card was created by 10 pharmaceutical companies to help patients gain access to needed medicines. The card is accepted at most pharmacies and gives patients savings at the pharmacy counter.</p>
