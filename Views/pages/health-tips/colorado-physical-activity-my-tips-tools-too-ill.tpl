<h1>I am in too ill health to exercise</h1>

	<h3>Listen to your body</h3>
	<p>Ease up when necessary. Successful exercisers feel at least as good after a workout as they did before. “No pain, no gain” is a discouraging and potentially dangerous idea that invites injury, particularly for previously inactive people.</p>

	<h3>Exercise at your own pace</h3>
	<p>Even if that is only a 5- to 10-minute walk at first. Consider stopping before you are really tired.</p>

	<h3>Take lapses in stride</h3>
	<p>You are bound to get sick, and go through periods where you don’t feel like exercising. Those lapses are a problem only if you let them discourage you or make you feel guilty. The trick is to get right back into your exercise routine, when you feel well again. Don’t despair if you miss a day now and then. Tell yourself that your lifelong commitment to exercise won’t be shaken by an occasional missed day.</p>

	<h3>Dealing with Pain</h3>
	<p>Over time, a regular exercise program can lesson your pain—but pain may keep you from getting started. Start slowly to warm up, pace yourself, and stretch gently when you are done. Ask your doctor what type of exercise is right for you.</p>
