<h1>“I eat junk food when I get depressed, and then I feel even worse”</h1>
<p>A common reaction to dealing with depression or stress is to eat foods that give us immediate gratification, namely foods that are high in sugar and fat. Eating these foods can give us short-term relief and gratification, yet in the long-term can make us feel “bad” or “guilty” and lead to weight gain, which can effect self-esteem. Recognizing that you respond to depression or stress by eating is the first step; the second step is to come up with some alternative strategies. Many people find engaging in other activities such as walking, yoga, or tai chi can help to alleviate depression symptoms — and the added benefit is that they are burning calories! You may also want to consider keeping your “trigger” foods (ones that you like to eat when feeling down) out of the house.</p>
