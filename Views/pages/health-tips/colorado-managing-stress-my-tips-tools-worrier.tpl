<h1>I’m a “worrier” — I have such a hard time shutting off my mind!</h1>
<p>Try scheduling “worry time” during the day where you write down the things that you are worried about and only focus on the ones that you can do something about and make a plan. The others — put them away in a mental compartment that can be dealt with at another time.</p>
