    <h4 class="h3">My family likes high-fat food</h4>

    <p>You may have a hard time eating healthful, low-fat food if your family insists on keeping unhealthful, high-fat food in the kitchen. Try:</p>

    <h5>Gradually cut back on unhealthful fatty foods in family meals</h5>

    <p>Go one step at a time. For example, switch from whole milk to 2% to 1%, and then to skim. Switch from whole-fat cheese to partial-skim cheese.</p>

    <h5>Separate out your portion of family meals before extra butter or other saturated fats are added</h5>

    <p>You can set aside your serving of mashed potatoes before the butter and milk are added, and then season with a little olive oil, lemon juice, or hot sauce. Separate your pasta or salad portions before cheese is added.</p>

    <h5>Prepare family favorites in a healthier way</h5>

    <p>Grill or broil instead of frying, or use a non-fat cooking spray. Try baked potatoes with lemon juice instead of butter, low-fat cottage cheese instead of sour cream, and instant pudding made with skim milk.</p>
