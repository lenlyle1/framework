<h1>I will use meditation or other relaxation techniques to manage my stress</h1>
    <p>The practice of meditation has been helpful in reducing stress in a variety of health conditions. Two common forms of meditation practiced in the US are Mindful Meditation and Transcendental Meditation or TM.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mindfulness meditation is primarily a focus on breath and attention.  It is practiced by bringing attention to the sensation of the flow of the breath and focusing attention on what is being experienced, without reacting to or judging it.</li>
        <li>Transcendental Meditation, or the TM technique, uses a silent but repetitive focus to create a relaxed awareness.  It begins by choosing a mantra (a word, sound, or phrase) and repeating it silently to prevent distracting thoughts from entering the mind.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To optimize meditation, it is important that you have a quiet place and space.  Consider the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Find a quiet location.</strong> Meditation is usually practiced in a quiet place with as few distractions as possible. </li>
        <li><strong>Get into a comfortable posture.</strong> Depending on the type of meditation being practiced, one can chose to sit, lay down, stand, walk, or assume other positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on attention.</strong> Focusing one's attention on an object or the sensations of the breath is usually a part of meditation. </li>
        <li><strong>Be open.</strong> Having an open attitude during meditation means letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them. When the attention goes to distracting or wandering thoughts, bring the attention back to the focus. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Relaxation techniques are also useful methods for reducing stress.  Biofeedback, guided imagery, breathing and/or muscle relaxation exercises are all examples of relaxation techniques. </p>

    <p>You can also lead yourself through visualization and relaxation exercises.  Following are some examples:</p>
    <h2>Visualization and Progressive Relaxation</h2>
    <h3>Visualization</h3>
    <p>The mind has an enormous healing ability. You can harness this ability by regularly practicing visualization, creating peaceful and healthful mental images that can directly affect your body.</p>
    <p>Here’s how to put visualization into practice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>While in a relaxed state, focus your mind on a calming image. You might imagine a peaceful countryside. Or a cool breeze. Some people imagine that good energy is flowing in their body, or that a particular part of their body is healing.</li>
        <li>Direct all of your thoughts to this image and allow yourself to experience what it feels like right now. Keep your attention there until you are satisfied with the picture you have created.</li>
        <li>Now spend 5 minutes holding that picture in your mind. If you find your mind wandering, gently return it to your image. Let the picture change, and watch the transformation occur.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Allow yourself to reflect on your peaceful image for a few minutes twice a day, as part of your regular stress-management routine. Many people discover that their images are always with them in the background. While your conscious imagery takes only a few minutes each day, your unconscious mind and your body will feel the benefits of this stress reliever nearly all the time.
    </p>
    <h3>Progressive Relaxation</h3>
    <p>This is a simple, step-by-step approach to relaxing every part of your body, the perfect antidote to stress. Progressive relaxation can help you become aware of how quiet and still the body and mind can be. You can take that awareness into your active, daily life and prevent the tension from building up.</p>
    <p>Try these steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Lie on your back with your eyes closed. Move around a little until you feel comfortable. You may want to place a pillow under your knees and under your head for more comfort. Then try to lie without moving.</li>
        <li>Begin by inhaling. Squeeze your right leg and raise it a few inches off the floor. Then let it drop to the floor as you exhale. Do the same with your left leg.</li>
        <li>Inhale and gently squeeze the right arm as you raise it a few inches off the floor. Hold it and then let it drop to the floor as you exhale. Do the same with your left arm.</li>
        <li>Now inhale deeply and contract the muscles of your buttocks as you raise your pelvis a few inches off the ground. Hold it, and then let it drop to the floor as you exhale.</li>
        <li>Press your elbows into the floor close to the ribs, and lift the rib cage off the mat. Inhale and expand it. Exhale and relax back to the floor.</li>
        <li>Inhale and draw your shoulders up to your ears, then exhale as you lengthen them toward the feet.</li>
        <li>Gently roll your head from side to side and allow your neck to relax. Inhale and squeeze together all of your facial muscles, including your jaw, mouth, eyes, and forehead. Exhale, opening your mouth wide, and extend your tongue (lion pose). Hold. Relax as you inhale, and exhale.</li>
        <li>Take a complete breath and expand fully. Then release it through the mouth with a sound like “haaa . . .,” letting your whole body sink into the floor.</li>
        <li>Finally, go through your body, mentally allowing each part of your body to relax even more.
            <ul>
                <li>Your feet, legs, hips. Relax.</li>
                <li>Your hands, arms, shoulders. Relax.</li>
                <li>Your buttocks, abdomen, chest, heart, throat. Relax.</li>
                <li>Your spine and all the muscles in the back and neck. Relax.</li>
                <li>All the muscles of your face and head. Relax.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Now bring your awareness to your breathing. Without trying to change your pattern of breathing, just observe or feel the gentle flow of air as it comes in and as your body begins to quiet down (about 1 minute).</li>
        <li>Observe what’s happening in your mind. Just notice whatever thoughts or feelings come up, but let them pass without trying to judge, suppress, or control them. (Allow 3-5 minutes of silence.)</li>
        <li>Gradually allow your inhalations to become a little deeper with each breath.</li>
        <li>Imagine that you are breathing in light and healing energy as well as oxygen that is revitalizing and recharging your body and mind.</li>
        <li>Slowly move your fingers and toes, hands and feet. Then gently roll your arms and legs back and forth.</li>
        <li>When you are ready, slowly roll over onto your side, and then come to a seated position.</li>
    </ol>
