<h1>After I come home from a stressful day at the office, I have a hard time winding down.</h1>
<p>Make your home a relaxing and safe place to be. Try some aromatherapy, such as oils of anise, basil, bay, chamomile, eucalyptus, lavender, peppermint, and rose — which are all soothing scents. Journaling or writing down your thoughts and feelings can also help to alleviate daily stress. Or go for a walk when you get home to “burn off the stress” and clear your head. </p>
