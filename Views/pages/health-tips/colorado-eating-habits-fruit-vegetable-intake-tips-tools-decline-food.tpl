    <h4 class="h3">I eat out a lot, and it’s hard to get Fruit & Vegetables in restaurants</h4>

    Eating out a lot can make it more challenging to eat healthfully, but there are some tricks you can learn to make sure that eating out doesn’t get in the way of your goals. Here’s a list of Tips that have helped other people.

    Make a conscious effort to select restaurants that offer more fresh fruits & vegetables

    Choose restaurants in your community that offer more fruits and vegetable on the menu, such as in soups, salads, side dishes, and desserts. Choose salads, fruit, extra lettuce and tomatoes on sandwiches, vegetable soups wherever possible. Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants provide many menu options that include stir-fried and steamed vegetables. Indian restaurants usually provide delicious vegetarian entrees.

    Order without looking at the menu

    Almost every restaurant has the basics — vegetables, grains and protein. Plan what you will have before you go to the restaurant. If you are uncomfortable asking for what you need, say that you are under doctor’s orders.

    Choose vegetables other than fried potatoes as a side dish

    Many restaurants will offer a salad, vegetable or soup as an alternative to French fries. Even breakfast places will often allow you to exchange fruit for hash browns.

    If given a choice of soups I will look for soups that contain vegetables

    Minestrone, tomato, bean, and vegetable soups are excellent choices. Clear broths will contain fewer fat and calories then creamy soups.

    When traveling or on the run, bring healthful foods along

    Keep healthful foods in the work refrigerator/freezer, or in your desk drawer. Keep on hand pre-cut veggies, instant vegetable soups, fruit, and yogurt with fruit.
