<h1>Every time I “diet” I feel so deprived of my favorite foods, and then I “pig out” on every sweet thing I can get my hands on</h1>
<p>We are all kids when it comes to depriving ourselves — the minute we say we can’t have something — we want lots of it! Avoid this trap by planning a small treat each day, although the key is to plan it and keep the portion size small. Mini-sized candy bars or “100 calorie cookie packets” are good examples.</p>
