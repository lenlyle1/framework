    <h4 class="h3">I will include a salad for lunch and dinner</h4>

    Variety is the “spice of life”, and often people can get into a rut when it comes to including salads into their diet. However, a salad can be whatever you want it to be! Lettuce salads are great and there are many great ways to eat them. What about tuna salad and egg salad? You can add veggies to these salads as well and have a great meal. Following are some creative ways to add a salad to your lunch or dinner meals:

    Lettuce salad: Create Your Own (choose one or more food item)

        Base
        Lettuce, spinach, baby greens, arugula, cabbage, broccoli slaw
        Protein
        Meat, egg, cheese, nuts/seeds or add a little of each if you’d like.
        Veggies
        Carrots, celery, radishes, peas, corn, roasted beets…the list goes on and on!
        Fruits
        Berries, dried fruit,

    Then dress with a light oil and vinegar and fresh herbs to taste!

    Protein salads: these salads take typical meat or poultry entrees and make them into a healthful and tasty salad:
