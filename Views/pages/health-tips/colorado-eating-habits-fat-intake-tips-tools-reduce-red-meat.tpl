    <h4 class="h3">I will reduce my intake of red meat</h4>

    <p>Why is it recommended to decrease the amount of red meat in your diet? In general, red meat (beef, pork and lamb) have more cholesterol and saturated (bad) fat than chicken, fish and vegetable proteins such as beans. Cholesterol and saturated fat can raise your blood cholesterol and make heart disease worse. The American Heart Association recommends limiting meat, chicken and fish intake to six ounces or less each day. In addition, there is also convincing evidence that choosing processed meat increases the chances of colorectal cancer. Studies show we can eat up to 18 ounces a week (a little less than three ounces per day) of red meat without raising cancer risk.</p>

    <h5>Step #1: Think about other sources of protein</h5>

    <p>The USDA recommends 56-78 grams of protein a day (for a 2,000 calorie diet). Most cuts of beef have about 21 grams of protein per 3 ounces; chicken has about 30 grams of protein per 3.5 ounces; and fish has about 22 grams of protein per 3.5 ounces.</p>

    <p>Lower fat protein choices include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Poultry:</b></p>
            <p>Especially white cuts such as the breast (remember to prepare without the skin).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Fish:</b></p>
            <p>The added bonus is that many types of fish (salmon, mackerel, trout, and herring) are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which are heart-healthy fats.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Low-fat or fat-free dairy:</b></p>
            <p>These are low in fat, high in protein and calcium, and provide other essential vitamins and minerals.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Eggs:</b></p>
            <p>Although egg yolks contain cholesterol, eggs are an excellent source of protein, and eating eggs in moderation can be part of a healthful diet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Plant sources of protein:</b></p>
            <p>Beans, legumes, tofu, nuts and seeds are also excellent sources of protein without the unhealthful fats.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Step #2: Check your portions</h5>

    <p>You can still eat red meat, but give grains and vegetables more space on your plate. Following are some tips on making your red meat choices more healthful:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>One portion of meat (3 ounces) is about the size of a deck of cards or the inside of the palm of your hand.</li>
        <li>Choose lean cuts of meat. Lean cuts usually contain the words “round,” “loin” or “sirloin” on the package.</li>
        <li>Trim off as much fat as you can before cooking, and pour off the melted fat after cooking.</li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Cooking Tip:</b></p>
            <p>Making grilled kebabs? Thread a single chunk of meat onto each skewer along with peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes, and you’ve done it!</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Step #3: Learn how to cook differently</h5>

    <p>Keep several meals a week red meat-free. When you are trying to reduce meat in your cooking, look for vegetarian recipes for ideas for how to prepare foods without meat or using less meat.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Grilled fish and poultry make tasty alternatives to red meat. Try canned fish including sardines, salmon, tuna and mackerel. These are all great in sandwiches or pasta dishes.</li>
        <li>Don't forget eggs, cottage cheese and hummus. These are all good sources of protein too.</li>
        <li>Swap processed meats for healthier alternatives. Instead of bacon, chorizo or salami, try spicy chicken or vegetarian sausages.</li>
        <li>Substitute beans for half of the meat in casseroles, soups and rice or noodle recipes. In one easy step you’ve halved your meat intake.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Step #4: Remember the other benefits of decreasing your red meat intake</h5>

    <p>Reducing red meat in your diet can help you spend less on food and focusing on vegetables may help you lose weight. Plant-based diets are also better for your heart, your weight, and your overall health. You don’t have to become a vegetarian. You’re just eating less red meat, which is better for your health overall.</p>
