<h1>My spouse says I should get a Medical Alert tag to wear and I donâ€™t want one</h1>

    <p>If you are taking medication for a serious condition such as heart disease, it is a good idea to wear a Medical Alert tag listing the name(s) of your illness and the medications you use to treat it/each. If you are not sure if you need a Medical Alert tag, discuss this with your doctor or healthcare team.</p>
