<h1>I just don’t like exercise</h1>

	<h3>Try a brand new exercise</h3>
	<p>Take a yoga class, get a new DVD, use weights or exercise bands, dance.  Exercise can be fun!</p>

	<h3>Set a goal and reward yourself</h3>
	<p>After walking a certain number of miles per week, reward yourself with a massage or new fitness gear.</p>

	<h3>Instead of thinking, “I hate exercising,” think, “I will have more energy if I exercise.”</h3>
	<br>

	<h3>Remember to track your progress</h3>

	<p>When you are making positive changes, feeling like you are making progress and reinforcing your accomplishments is important. Buy a stopwatch so that you can time and keep track of two-minute walks (they really do add up).</p>

	<p class="centered">—OR—</p>

	<p>Get a pedometer which will detect small changes in your activity, and show you that even small changes do count and add up over time. Or use one of the free apps to map your walk or bike ride.  </p>
