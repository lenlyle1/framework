<h1>Whenever I go on vacation or travel, I either forget to bring my medications or I forget to take them!</h1>

    <p>Simply getting out of a routine can play havoc with your normal medication regime. When packing for vacation, think about placing your medications in a place where you pack usual items, such as your toothbrush. You can also place a sticky note next to your suitcase to remind you to pack your medications. When you are on vacation, consider setting your phone alarm to remind you to take your medications, or ask your traveling partner to remind you to take your medications.</p>
