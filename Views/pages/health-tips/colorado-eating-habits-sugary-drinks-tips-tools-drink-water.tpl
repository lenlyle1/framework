    <h4 class="h3">I will choose to drink water instead</h4>

    At least half of your daily fluid should come from water. If you get bored with plain water, here are some ways to flavor it without adding table sugar.

        Citrus fruits like lemons, limes and oranges, work well for flavoring water. But donâ€™t stop there; try berries, pineapple and watermelon too. Many grocery stores sell small containers of pre-cut fruit, so you can flavor water on the go as well.
        Cucumber is a refreshing addition
        Mint and thyme are great additions to citrus and berry flavored waters
        Add a splash of 100% fruit juice
        Try a different flavored seltzer water

    Following are some ways to help you stay on track with drinking more water:

        Fill your take-a-long water bottle in the morning and refill it throughout the day.
        Carry plain or flavored bottles of water in your car.
        Order a cup of ice on the go and add water.
        Check off on your list every time you drink 8 oz. of water
        Don't "stock the fridge" with sugar-sweetened beverages. Instead, keep a jug or bottles of cold water in the fridge.
        Serve water with meals.
