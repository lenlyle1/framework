    <h4 class="h3">I have little or no willpower (especially when I’m stressed out)</h4>

    <p>Many people wrestle with food choices when they are feeling vulnerable or under stress. Try:</p>

    <h5>Bring your own food or avoid work/school events where you would be tempted by unhealthful choices</h5>

    <p>Bring your own healthful lunch or snacks, such as fresh fruit, carrot or celery sticks, and dried fruits and nuts.</p>

    <h5>When you eat a fatty food, eat half of your normal portion</h5>

    <p>Either take a half-sized portion (if you're at home) or divide the serving in half and only eat half (if you're at a restaurant).</p>

    <h5>Keep healthful food in front and high-fat food out of sight</h5>

    <p>You will be more likely to grab healthful food—like ready-to-eat vegetables, fruit, and low-fat yogurt, if they are readily available and in plain sight. Rearrange your fridge and cupboards today!</p>
