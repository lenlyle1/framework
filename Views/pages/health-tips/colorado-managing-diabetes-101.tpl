<h1>Diabetes 101</h1>

<p>Before going further, you may have many questions about diabetes. What is it? How serious is it? This section provides an overview of diabetes. Your doctor can also answer other questions you have about diabetes. These are important conversations between you and your medical home team.</p>

<h3>What is Diabetes?</h3>


<p>Diabetes affects how your body uses blood glucose. Blood glucose is commonly called blood sugar. Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel. If you have diabetes, you have too much glucose in your blood. The reasons for having too much glucose may differ from person to person.</p>

<h3>What is Insulin? (From the American Diabetes website)</h3>


<p>Insulin is what your body needs to use the food you eat for energy. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. It acts like a key that opens the door for the food (glucose) to leave your bloodstream and enter your cells.
<br><br>
A problem with insulin is one reason why blood glucose may build up in your blood. When this happens:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your pancreas no longer makes any insulin OR the insulin you have doesn't work.</li>
    <li>Without insulin, glucose can't get into your cells.</li>
    <li>Since the cells can't get any food (glucose), they starve for energy while glucose builds up in your blood.</li>
    <li>In order to help their bodies use glucose, some people need to inject insulin using a syringe or use an insulin pump.</li>

</ul>



<h3>What are some symptoms of high blood glucose? (from www.Joslin.org)</h3>


<p>Symptoms vary from person to person. Some people have no symptoms. Sometimes symptoms are mistaken for other problems. About 1 in 4 people with diabetes are not aware they have it. What is important is a change in how often you experience the items listed below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Increased thirst</li>
    <li>Blurred vision</li>
    <li>Feeling tired</li>
    <li>Increased urination</li>
    <li>Slow healing cuts</li>
    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
    <li>Dry mouth or skin</li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
</ul>


<h3>How long will I have diabetes?</h3>


<p>There is no cure for diabetes. Instead, people make long-term adjustments to their lifestyles that help keep their diabetes under control.</p>




<h3>How common is diabetes in the United States?</h3>


<ul>
    <li>Every 17 seconds, someone is diagnosed with diabetes.</li>
    <li>26 million people have diabetes (8.3% of the U.S. population).</li>
    <li>26.9% of U.S. residents aged 65 years and older have diabetes.</li>
    <li>Most people are over age 40 when diagnosed. But Type 2 is becoming more common in younger adults, teens, and children due to the increase in the rates of obesity.</li>

</ul>



<h3>What is “Sugar”?</h3>


<p>When you think of diabetes, you may often think of “sugar.” Your spouse may tell you to be careful to not eat too much sugar. Your friends may say that you have “The Sugar” instead of saying diabetes. Your doctor may talk about testing your blood sugar level. But are they talking about the same thing?</p>




<h3>Is table sugar different than blood sugar?</h3>


<p>Yes. Most people think of white crystals when they hear the word “sugar.” This sugar is a type of carbohydrate and goes by many names. Common names include table sugar, brown sugar, molasses, honey, beet sugar, cane sugar, powdered sugar, maple syrup, high-fructose corn syrup. Its chemical name is sucrose.
<br><br>
There are two main types of sugar and both will raise blood sugar (glucose) levels:</p>


<ul>
    <li>natural sugars, such as those in milk or fruit</li>
    <li>added sugars, such as fruit canned in heavy syrup or sugar added to cookies</li>
</ul>


<p>The word "sugar" in "blood sugar" is a loose term. Blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to sugar that is transported through the bloodstream to supply energy to all the cells in our bodies for energy. This sugar comes from all of the food we eat, not just white frosting on birthday cakes. The human body works to maintain a blood glucose level that is neither too high nor too low.</p>



<h3>Why does too much blood glucose matter?</h3>


<p>Diabetes can lead to serious health problems. If left uncontrolled, diabetes may lead to death or to other conditions that can severely impact your quality of life.

</p>

<h1>Physical Effects</h1>

<p>If not managed, diabetes can be harmful to several parts of the body. Diabetes can damage and cause poor functioning in organs and tissue, including: Eyes, Blood vessels and arteries,
Kidneys, Heart, Circulation, Nerves, Feet, Bones (osteoprosis).</p>

<h1>Mental and Emotional Effects</h1>

<p>Being told you have diabetes can be life-changing. You may experience some mental and emotional effects. You may feel some form of depression, anxiety, or even a sense of grief. This is normal. Share these emotions and experiences with your doctor. Together, you can address and manage these effects - together.</p>



<h3>What changes blood glucose levels?</h3>

<p>Blood sugar levels change during the course of a day — and from day to day. That is important information to learn. The goal is to lower your blood sugar level and to keep it within a constant range as much as possible.
<br><br>
Managing diabetes requires being aware of your blood sugar level. To start, know what can make your blood sugar level rise or fall.</p>


<ul>
    <li>Food (what and how much)</li>
    <li>Alcohol</li>
    <li>Exercise</li>
    <li>Stress</li>
    <li>Medications</li>
    <li>Illness</li>

</ul>



<h3>What should my blood sugar levels be? (From ADA)</h3>

<p>Target blood glucose (or sugar) levels can be very individualized. Why? Several factors play a role in your blood glucose. They include:</p>


<ul>
    <li>How long you've had diabetes</li>
    <li>Other conditions (high blood pressure, heart disease, etc.)</li>
    <li>Other individual issues</li>
    <li>Age</li>

</ul>

<p>General blood glucose guidelines from the American Diabetes Association for people with Type 2 Diabetes are:</p>


<table width="800" border="1" cellpadding="10">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Before meals or when waking up in the morning:</td>
      <td>2 hours after the start of a meal:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>70-130 mg/dL</td>
      <td>< 180 mg/dL</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>You and your medical home team should set your goals together blood glucose (or sugar) goals together. Every drop in blood glucose can make a difference in your health. Your goals may change over time, as you learn how to manage your diabetes over time.</p>
