<h1>I am too old to exercise</h1>

	<h3>Put a positive spin on your age instead of using it as an excuse to not exercise</h3>

	<p>Instead of telling yourself you are too old, use it as fuel to make yourself exercise even harder.</p>

	<h3>Turn back the clock with exercise!</h3>

	<p>You can credit exercise for giving you great bursts of energy no matter what age you are. Strength training can do a lot for you too, including protecting the bone and muscle mass you start losing at age forty. These loses are actually due to slowing down, not necessarily age. <strong>After one year of strength training, your body can be fifteen to twenty years more youthful</strong>.</p>

	<h3>Remind yourself of this: Exercise and strength training, we have learned, is the fountain of youth</h3>
	<p>Remind yourself that muscle loss is responsible for the frailty and diminished vitality we associate with old age. This doesn’t have to happen to you! Research has shown that muscle loss can be prevented…if you have lost strength, you can regain it; if your energy has sagged, you can raise it, if you have lost muscle and gained fat, you can reverse it, if you have become flabby, you can get trim; if you feel older than you like, you can feel younger, stronger, and more vigorous — perhaps better than you have ever felt in your entire life.</p>
