<h1>Iâ€™ve tried quitting smoking in the past and I end up giving into the nicotine cravings</h1>
<p>Many people find that they need a powerful, personal reason to quit smoking. Perhaps you want to protect your family from the health effects from secondhand smoke. Maybe the thought of lung cancer frightens you. Or it could be that you would like to look and feel younger. Choose a reason that is strong enough to outweigh the urge to light up.</p>
