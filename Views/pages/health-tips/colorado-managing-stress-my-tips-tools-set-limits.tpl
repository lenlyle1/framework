<h1>I will set limits on taking care of others</h1>

    <p>Knowing your limits is important, especially when managing your stress.  Establishing limits helps to reduce stress because you’ve recognized what you can do and helps you focus on those aspects of your life.  </p>
    <p>Many of us find ourselves in situations where we are taking care of our own children, our aging parents, and a home and job!  It can be stressful and overwhelming to try and “do it all”.  The first step is to develop a working a list of things you do or can do for others.  Ask yourself what makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed? The answers to this question helps you identify what your limits are and what you may consider saying “no” to. </p>
    <p>Next, consider other questions that may help guide your decision process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How much of your time and yourself you can give?</li>
        <li>Are you setting realistic boundaries?</li>
        <li>Have you factored in your own care?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you have identified your limits, communicate those limits to family members, friends, and doctors.   Remember that others can help you when caring for others.  Engage other family members or friends, or consider a professional organization.  And most importantly, keep in mind that the best way to take care of others is to also <i>take care of yourself</i>.  </p>
