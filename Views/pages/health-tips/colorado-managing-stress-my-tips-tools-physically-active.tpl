<h1>I will stay physically active to lower stress</h1>

    <p>Exercise is a good stress reliever, regardless of your fitness level. Plus, the lingering effects of exercise and mood are impressive!</p>
    
    <h3>Exercise and stress relief</h3>

<p>Exercise increases your overall health and your sense of well-being, which puts more pep in your step every day. But exercise also has some direct stress-busting benefits.</p>

   <ul>
       <li><b>It pumps up your endorphins.</b> Physical activity helps to bump up the production of your brain's feel-good neurotransmitters, called endorphins. Although this function is often referred to as a runner's high, a rousing game of tennis or a nature hike also can contribute to this same feeling.</li>
       
       <li><b>It's meditation in motion.</b> After a fast-paced game of racquetball or several laps in the pool, you'll often find that you've forgotten the day's irritations and concentrated only on your body's movements. As you begin to regularly shed your daily tensions through movement and physical activity, you may find that this focus on a single task, and the resulting energy and optimism, can help you remain calm and clear in everything that you do.</li>
       
       
       <li><b>It improves your mood.</b> Regular exercise can increase self-confidence and lower the symptoms associated with mild depression and anxiety. Exercise also can improve your sleep, which is often disrupted by stress, depression and anxiety. All this can ease your stress levels and give you a sense of command over your body and your life.</li>
   </ul>
