<h1>I will work with a personal trainer</h1>
	<h3>What is the benefit of working with a personal trainer?</h3>

	<p>Motivation is the most common answer to this question. Left to our own decisions, it can be pretty easy to not push ourselves physically. Whether it is a cardio or strengthening activity, a trainer sets the limits and stays there to make us accountable for reaching them. This type of monitoring is helpful for getting our hearts and muscles to a stronger state.</p>
	<p>Other benefits include:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Saves time</strong> personal trainers are able to help you figure out what equipment and exercises best fit for you.</li>
		<li><strong>Reduces injuries</strong> many people donâ€™t know how to properly use many types of exercise equipment and weight machines. Personal trainers can assist with showing you how equipment and machines properly work.</li>
		<li><strong>Customized exercise program</strong> a knowledgeable personal trainer can create a customized exercise program that is designed to help you reach your unique health and fitness goals.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Finding and hiring a personal trainer</h3>
	<p>A trainer should be a knowledgeable and trusted resource for fitness. Ask if the trainer(s) have completed training from:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
		</li>
		<li>
			The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA)
		</li>
		<li>
			The American Council on Exercise (ACE)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These credentials are helpful to ensure that the trainer is prepared to help individuals meet their fitness goals.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also find a trainer that works with special conditions, like arthritis or other chronic diseases. Interview any prospective personal trainer about their experience working with other clients with chronic diseases or physical limitations. Ask to speak with a couple of their clients so that you can find out first-hand if their training methods are a good fit for your needs.
	</p>

	<h3>Costs and Services</h3>
	<p>
		The average cost of working with a trainer averages $50 per hour, with a range of $15-100/hour. You can work with a trainer one-on-one or with a small group. Small group training sessions help with cost sharing and motivation!
	</p>
	<p>
		Check with your local gyms and independent trainers to learn more about what they offer and what they specialize in when you begin your search. Finding the	right trainer is an important step to meeting your goals.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whether you are interested in starting slow or gearing up for a major fitness milestone, a trainer can help you stay on track and meet your fitness goals.
