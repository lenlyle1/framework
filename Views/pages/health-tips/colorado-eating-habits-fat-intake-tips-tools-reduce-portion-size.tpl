    <h4 class="h3">I will decrease my portion sizes of high fat foods</h4>

    <p>Many times the problem is not so much what we eat but how much we eat! Getting a handle on your portion sizes is a key to improving your overall diet and health. This is particularly important for high fat foods as they can be high in calories and saturated fat, which may contribute to increased risk for obesity and heart disease.</p>

    <h5>On-Hand Tips for Portion Control</h5>

    <p>Using a simple tool such as your hand can help guide how much you are actually eating, and no measuring cups or scales are needed!</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>1 Fist:</b> 1 cup cereal, pasta or vegetables</li>
        <li><b>1 Finger:</b> 1 ounce of cheese</li>
        <li><b>1 Thumb tip:</b> 1 tsp of peanut butter, butter, or sugar</li>
        <li><b>1 Palm:</b> 3 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry</li>
        <li><b>1 Handful:</b> 1 ounce of nuts</li>
        <li><b>2 Handfuls:</b> 2 ounces of chips or pretzels</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Tips for portion control of high fat foods at restaurants and home:</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Supersized portion:</b></p>
            <p>An average fast food meal can run 1000 calories or more, so choose a smaller portion size, order a side salad instead of fries, and don't supersize anything. At a typical restaurant, a single serving provides enough for two meals. Take half home or divide the portion with a dining partner. At home, serve meals on smaller plates. This helps keep reasonable portion sizes in check.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Buffets — even seemingly healthy ones like salad bars:</b></p>
            <p>If you do choose buffet dining, opt for using the salad-sized plate to help control your portion sizes. Choose fresh fruits, salads with olive oil &amp; vinegar or low-fat dressings, broiled entrees, and steamed vegetables. Resist the temptation to go for seconds, or wait at least 20 minutes after eating to make sure you're really still hungry before going back for more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>“Undress” your food:</b></p>
            <p>Even smaller portion foods can come “dressed” in calorie and fat-laden sauces and spreads. When choosing items, be aware of calorie- and fat-packed salad dressings, spreads, cheese, sour cream, etc. For example, ask for or prepare a grilled chicken sandwich without the mayonnaise. Use a packet of ketchup or mustard and add it yourself, controlling how much you put on your sandwich.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
