<h1>3. Taking Medication:</h1>
<p>One of the most common questions is “Do I need to take a pill to control my diabetes?” Many people do not want to take a medication. They do not want to need to rely on a pill to be healthy. They do not want to pay for it. They do not want the side effects. Others believe that a pill will solve all of their problems. They believe they will be OK if they just take their pills. Not surprisingly, both responses pose problems. Taking medication may greatly help manage your diabetes. It may be necessary. Eating well, being physically active, and monitoring your blood glucose are also very important actions that should not be ignored.</p>

<h2>Types of Diabetes Medication:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <u>Oral medications</u>: Oral medications refer to medications that are taken usually in pill form. These medications try to improve the way the body handle its own insulin. They target organs such as the liver, pancreas, and muscles.</li>
    <li>
        <u>Insulin</u>: Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. It acts like a key that opens the door for the food (glucose) to leave your bloodstream and enter your cells. Insulin is usually taken by injection or using an insulin pump.</li>
</ol>
<p>Review the following information about medications. Since each person is so unique, talking with your doctor about your specific situation is very important. Do not be afraid to ask questions about medications. This is a very important conversation to have with your doctor.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Do I need to start taking a medication right away?</h4>
        <p>The severity of your diabetes is the most important factor. The primary way to determine severity is by the A1c level. If your A1c is &lt;8, you may be able to control your diabetes and lower your blood glucose level by eating well and exercising. This is a decision to make with your doctor. If your A1c is &gt;8, most likely your doctor will ask you to start taking a medication.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Do I really need to take my medication?</h4>
        <p>Yes. Diabetes medication can help you control your diabetes. Taking your medication as you are instructed (amount, time of day). This is very important.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>What are some common diabetes medications?</h4>
        <p>There are many medications on the market for diabetes. Metformin is a very common first choice. Your medication depends on your specific situation and other health conditions. For example, you will probably not be prescribed Metformin if you have kidney problems.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Are there specific instructions? What matters?</h4>
        <p><u>VERY IMPORTANT</u>: If you need to take a medication, take it regularly as prescribed. <u>WHEN</u> you take your medication matters. Diabetes medication is not the kind that you can take when you feel like it or when you remember.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you are taking a medication that is released over a 24-hour period, it is very important that you take your medication at the same time every day.</li>
            <li>If you are not taking a 24-hour release medication, take your medication before meals.</li>
            <li>In general, do not take your medication before exercising.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>What if I cannot pay for medication?</h4>
        <p>Too often people cannot pay for medications but do not let their doctors know this. Do not let the cost of medication keep you from taking it. Talk with your doctor. There may be a less expensive alternative or a way to receive medication at a lower cost.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>What are possible side effects?</h4>
        <p>First, don’t assume that you will have side effects. Many people experience no side effects when taking medication for their diabetes. Possible side effects include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nausea</li>
            <li>Diarrhea</li>
            <li>Feeling tired</li>
            <li>If taking insulin, you may experience some light-headedness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Pay attention to how you feel. Write down any changes to how you feel. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling <u>at every visit.</u>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Does medication for diabetes effect other medications?</h4>
        <p>Yes they can. Antibiotics and medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol can affect diabetes medication — and the other way around. Other examples exist, too. Be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you are taking, including over-the-counter medications.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>High Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Medications</h4>
<p>There are dozens of medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol.
    <br>These medications may interact with those for diabetes. A careful plan created by you and your medical home team is very important.</p>
<h4>Know this: There is strong evidence that supports treating high blood pressure and high cholesterol more aggressively in people with diabetes. This can help prevent bad health outcomes.</h4>
