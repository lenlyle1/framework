    <h3>Managing Stress</h3>
    <p>Stress is a normal psychological and physical reaction to day-to-day life demands. Our bodies are “hard wired” to handle stress. When your brain perceives a threat, it signals your body to release a burst of hormones to fuel your ability to respond. This has been labeled the “fight-or-flight” response. Today’s stressors differ from our ancestor’s sources of stress — running away from dangerous animals or other predators — yet our physiological response to stress is exactly the same. This is why managing stress is so important! Without stress management techniques, your body is continually on “high alert”, which can lead to some serious health problems.</p>
