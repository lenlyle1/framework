    <h4 class="h3">I will try a new fruit or vegetable each week</h4>

    There are a variety of different fruits and vegetables available in markets these days — yet it is easy to get into a rut and buy and eat the same ones! Following are some tips and ideas for adding a new fruit or vegetable to your diet each week:

    Farmers Market — many cities and towns offer local produce sold at farmers markets, especially in the spring and summer.
    Do a “Fruit & Vegetable” challenge with your family or co-workers! Track for two weeks who can try the most number of new fruits and vegetables — then compare notes for the tastiest choice.
    Choose a new color of fruit or vegetable to try each day! For example:
        Monday’s green: Bok Choy
        Tuesday’s orange: Orange pepper
        Wednesday’s yellow: Star fruit or yellow squash
        Thursday’s red: red chard
        Friday’s purple: eggplant
        Saturday’s pink: pink grapefruit
        Sunday’s white: a different type of mushroom or onion
    Try a fruit or vegetable you usually eat, but prepare it in a different way:
        Put sweet potatoes in chili, stew, or in pancakes
        Add apples or berries to a salad
    Planning a vacation or pick out an exotic place you want to go and try a fruit or vegetable from that area:
        For example, planning (or hoping to plan a trip) to a tropical island? Each week try a different tropical fruit, such as guava, papaya, plantain, mango, or star fruit.
