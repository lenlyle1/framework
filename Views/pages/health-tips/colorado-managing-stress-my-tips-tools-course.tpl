<h1>I will attend a stress-management course or support group in the community</h1>
    <p>You may be considering taking a class or attending a support group to help manage stress.  Yoga and tai chi provide stress relief through mindful breathing and physical activity. </p>

   <ul>
       <li>Hatha yoga is the most common form of yoga for relieving stress.  It is good for beginners because it is practiced at a slower pace with movements that are easily modified for most fitness levels.   </li>
       <li>Like yoga, Tai chi helps reduce stress and anxiety while helping to increase flexibility and balance. Tai chi involves a series of movements performed in a slow, focused manner and accompanied by deep breathing.  Tai chi is low impact and puts minimal stress on muscles and joints. You may also find tai chi appealing because it's inexpensive, requires no special equipment and can be done either alone or in a group. </li>
       <li>Check your local recreation center for classes to learn more about stress management or participate in stress management activity like, yoga, tai-chi, meditation and muscle relaxation.  </li>
   </ul>

   <strong>Although tai chi and Hatha yoga are generally safe, consult your health care provider before trying new exercise or stress management methods.</strong>

   <h3>Stress Management Books and Videos:</h3>

   <ul>
       <li>Check out books or videos on stress management techniques at your local library for free.</li>
       <li>Search YouTube for reliable stress management videos.  The videos are often accompanied by a thumbs up or down and the number of people that have watched it.  Videos that have been watched by thousands of people or even hundreds of thousands of people may be worth watching.  You can also read what people have to say about the video before deciding to push play for yourself. <br>

   <h3>Support Groups</h3>
   <p>Finding a support group that suits your needs requires some inquiry to find out about groups and then some time to determine if it feels right for you.  To get started:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
        Ask your doctor or other health care provider for assistance in recommending a support group for you.
        </li>
        <li>
        Contact community centers, libraries, and faith-based groups in your area.
        </li>
        <li>
        Ask others you know with the same illness or life situation for suggestions.  For example, many locations have support groups for people with diabetes, asthma, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        Contact a state or national organization devoted to your disease, condition or situation.  For example, the American Diabetes Association has national and local organizational hubs. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Search the Internet. Online support groups are available as email lists, newsgroups, chat rooms, blogs and social networking sites.
        </li>
    </ul>
