<h1>I will decrease the times each week when I miss my medications</h1>

    <p>Missing medication doses each week can have an effect on your overall health. Medications work best when they are taken as prescribed by your doctor. Following are some tips to help you decrease the number of time you miss taking your medications:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Check off on a calendar or reminder sheet every time you take your medication as prescribed.</li>
        <li>Medication reminders are helpful for staying on top of your medication regime. Developing a pattern for the time and place that you do this every day is the most useful strategy if you are forgetting to take the medication. See the section titled <em>I Will Keep My Medication in the Same Place</em>.</li>
        <li>If you are skipping medication due to costs, investigate the PAP or Prescription Assistance Program. This program offers assistance for mediation expenses. But donâ€™t stop there. First, tell your doctor that the cost of the medication(s) is a barrier. Then, ask if there are alternative medications that would be less expensive.</li>
        <li>If you have troubles with picking up medications, ask for support from family or friends. There are also ways to have your medications delivered by the mail.</li>
        <li>Keep your medications in a visible place, such as your kitchen or bathroom counter. However, keep in mind that some medications should be kept out of direct sunlight, and be aware if small children are in the household.</li>
    </ul>
