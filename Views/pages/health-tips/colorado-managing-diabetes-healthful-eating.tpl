<h1>1. Healthful Eating: Manage Diabetes by Eating Well!</h1>
		<p><strong>Having diabetes does not mean you must completely give up certain foods</strong>, but it does change the kinds of foods you should eat on daily basis. What you eat affects your diabetes. There is an endless amount of information about nutrition and diabetes. The consistent and simple message around food and diabetes boils down to this:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Eat larger portions of non-starchy vegetables</li>
			<li>Eat smaller portions of sugary, starchy foods</li>
			<li>Weight management - losing even a small amount of weight can improve your diabetes management</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Myth:</strong> Carbohydrates are bad for people with diabetes â€” avoid them<br>
		<strong>Fact:</strong> Carbohydrates are an important part of a healthful diet, including diets for those with diabetes. Carbohydrates have more of an impact on blood glucose (sugar) levels than either fat or protein. Some carbohydrates are better than others and whole grain choices are recommended over refined carbohydrates.

</li><li>vegetable juice, salsa, onion, cucumber, beets, okra,
mushrooms, peppers, turnip<br>Note: starchy vegetables include corn, peas, and potatoes</li></ul></li>

<li>Now in one of the small sections, put your <strong>meat or meat substitutes</strong>:
<ul><li>chicken or turkey without the skin
</li><li>fish such as tuna, salmon, cod, or catfish
</li><li>other seafood such as shrimp, clams, oysters, crab, or mussels
</li><li>lean cuts of beef and pork such as sirloin or pork loin
</li><li>tofu, eggs, low-fat cheese</li></ul>
</li>

<li>In the other small sections put <strong>starchy foods</strong>, such as:
