<h1>I will decrease my weekly alcohol intake to meet the moderate drinking guidelines</h1>
<p>Moderate drinking, for people not struggling with alcohol, is defined by the number of drinks per day or week, gender and age. For adults, healthy men up to age 65 should limit themselves to:</p>
<ul><li>Up to 2 drinks each day</li>
<li>No more than 4 drinks in a single day</li>
<li>No more than 14 drinks in a week</li></ul>
<p>Healthy women of all ages and healthy men over age 65 should limit themselves to:</p>
<ul><li>Up to 1 drink each day</li>
<li>No more than 3 drinks in a single day</li>
<li>No more than 7 drinks in a week</li></ul>
<p>One drink is defined as a 12-ounce can or bottle of beer, a 5-ounce glass of wine, a wine cooler, or 1 cocktail or shot of hard liquor.</p> 
<h3>Think about:</h3>
<ul><li>How often you have any alcoholic drinks at all</li>
<li>How many drinks you have when you do drink</li>
<li>How any drinking you are doing is affecting your life or the people around you</li></ul>
<h3>Set a Goal to Drink Less</h3>
<p>Decide how many days a week you want to drink and how many drinks you’ll have on those days. It’s a good idea to have some days when you don’t drink. Drinking within the limits reduces the chances of having an alcohol use disorder and related health problems.</p>
<h3>Pacing and Spacing </h3>
<p>When you do drink, pace yourself. Sip slowly. Have no more than one drink with alcohol per hour. Alternate “drink spacers” — non-alcoholic drinks such as water, soda, or juice — with drinks containing alcohol.</p>
<h3>Include Food</h3>
<p>Don’t drink on an empty stomach — have some food so the alcohol will be absorbed more slowly into your system.</p>
