<h1>I smoke when I am stressed, and if I canâ€™t get a handle on my stress, I will never be able to stop smoking</h1>
<p>Many people find that smoking helps them to relax. So once you quit, it is important to find another way to deal with stress. Try other stress management techniques, such as going for a walk, listening to relaxing music, learning yoga or tai chi, or getting a massage. If possible, avoid stressful situations during the first few weeks after you stop smoking.</p>
