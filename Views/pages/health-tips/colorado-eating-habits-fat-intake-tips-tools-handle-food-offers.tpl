    <h4 class="h3">I don‘t know how to decline offers of unhealthful food</h4>

    <p>For people who work hard to eat low-fat foods, social situations can raise concerns, fear, and even apprehension. Try:</p>

    <h5>Learn how to decline food gracefully</h5>

    <p>If a friend or co-worker breaks out a bag of mini candy bars, ask yourself, “Am I going to feel better if I have one?” You can learn the habit of saying no and moving on—and of saying yes only if you really want to.</p>

    <h5>Say that you are full</h5>

    <p>When people offer you high-fat food that they have proudly prepared, you can say it looks wonderful, but that at the moment you are full.</p>

    <h5>Be assertive</h5>

    <p>It is inevitable that someone, somewhere, sometime will urge you to try a high-fat food that does not fit within your eating plan. You can assert yourself and just say “No, thank you.”</p>

    <h5>Enlist social support</h5>

    <p>Asking for the help and support of friends and family members can be a great way to avoid unhealthful food temptations. Let them know that you are serious about eating lower-fat food, and ask them not to offer you “even one piece of candy.”</p>
