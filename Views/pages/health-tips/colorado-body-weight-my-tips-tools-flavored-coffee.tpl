<h1>I really like flavored coffee drinks and they are such a treat for me in the morning</h1>
<p>“Liquid” calories can really add up and can lead to weight gain or sabotage your weight loss efforts. If you really like your café mocha latte in the morning, consider having a smaller portion size and having it made with skim or 1% milk. And skip the bagel or scone that you usually have with it!</p>
