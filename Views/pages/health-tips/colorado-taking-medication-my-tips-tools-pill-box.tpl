<h1>I will buy a weekly pill box to put my medications in so that I can keep track of when I take my medications</h1>

    <p>21<sup>st</sup> century pill boxes range from the basic box with seven small compartments for each day of the week to high tech electronic reminder boxes. They can cost as little as $1 or as much as $300+ for electronic models. Nonetheless, they all do the same thing. They serve as a reminder that we have or have not taken our medication on a given day.</p>
