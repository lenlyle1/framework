    <p>Research has shown that cutting back on unhealthful fats—like trans fats and saturated fats—can reduce your chances of getting cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses. There are numerous types of fat, and your body makes its own fat from taking in excess calories. Dietary fat is one of the three macronutrients, along with protein and carbohydrates, which provide energy for your body. While it is true that many fats are bad for you, some fats can actually lower your risk of heart disease.</p>

    <h5>How do you tell a healthful fat from an unhealthful fat?</h5>

    <p>Unhealthful fats (limit to < 10% of your daily calories or avoid):</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Saturated fats:</b>
            <br>
            Found mostly in fatty meats, whole fat dairy products, lard and shortening.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Trans fatty acids:</b>
            <br>
            Found mostly in hard stick margarine, shortening, many deep fat frying oils, and most processed or convenience foods. Foods with “partially hydrogenated oils” have trans fatty acids.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Why are these fats bad for me?</h5>

    <p>Unhealthful fats raise cholesterol levels and the increase your risk of heart disease.</p>

    <h5>What foods contain unhealthful fats?</h5>

    <p>To find out if a food has saturated fat or trans fatty acids in it, look for the words: “saturated fat”, “partially hydrogenated oils” or “trans fat” on the ingredient labels.</p>

    <h5>Foods to AVOID or eat less of:</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>High-fat and fried meats.</li>
        <li>Packaged baked goods (cookies, cakes, crackers).</li>
        <li>Snack foods and chips.</li>
        <li>Butter, gravy, dressings and sauces made with animal or solid fats.</li>
        <li>Sausage, bacon, ribs, high fat sandwich meats</li>
        <li>Lard, coconut, palm and other tropical oils</li>

    </ul>

    <h5>Healthful fats</h5>

    <p>Healthful fats are Unsaturated fats contained in olive oil, Canola and soy oils, fish, nuts, natural nut butters, seeds, olives, and avocados. Unsaturated fats include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Monounsaturated fat:</b>
            <br>
            This type of fat is found in a variety of foods and oils. Studies show that eating food rich in monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease. Research also shows that MUFAs may benefit insulin levels and blood sugar control, which can be helpful if you have type 2 diabetes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Polyunsaturated fat:</b>
            <br>
            This type of fat is found mostly in plant-based foods and oils. Evidence shows that eating foods rich in polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) improves blood cholesterol levels, and may decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes.
