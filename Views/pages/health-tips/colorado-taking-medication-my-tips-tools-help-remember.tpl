<h1>I will ask my spouse, family member, or friend to help me to remember to take my medications</h1>
    <p>Remembering to take your medication(s) is a good way of reminding yourself that you are taking care of yourself. Your decision to fill prescriptions and take them as directed is a vital part of your care.</p>
    <p>Asking a family member or friend for support with your medication regime may be a good idea for you. You may consider asking for help to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>pay for medications</li>
		<li>pick up prescriptions</li>
		<li>read labels</li>
		<li>fill pill boxes</li>
		<li>provide transportation to your doctor’s office or pharmacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are also other helpful tips and reminders in the section called <em>I will use a pill box</em>. There are many traditional (make a note for yourself) and sophisticated reminder systems (electronic pill dispensers with sensory alerts) available. Check them out—one of them might be a great fit for you!</p>
