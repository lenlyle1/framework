    <h4 class="h3">I don't have time to cook</h4>

    <p>With all the other things you have to do, it can be hard to find time to cook. Yet, people who cook for themselves eat more healthful diets. Try:</p>

    <h5>Select lower-fat options at restaurants</h5>

    <p>Ask to have your chicken or fish broiled, baked, or poached; use olive oil and vinegar on salads if available (or just use lemon wedges); and substitute plain baked potatoes for French fries.</p>

    <h5>Stock up on low-fat, quick-to-fix recipes and meals</h5>

    <p>Plan meals around low-fat foods that are quick to prepare or ready to eat. Healthful soup, tuna noodle casserole, bean burritos, vegetable omelets, and pasta with vegetables and tomato sauce can be prepared in minutes.</p>

    <h5>Keep on hand frozen, low-fat entrees</h5>

    <p>Just heat and eat, and add an instant salad using pre-chopped and pre-washed salad greens.</p>
