<h1>I will ask my spouse, family member, care giver, or friend to help me to decrease my alcohol intake</h1>

<p>Having the support of friends and family members is an invaluable asset — and most importantly — don’t go on this journey alone.  Ask people who may be willing to listen and help, such as a spouse or significant other, or non-drinking friends. People that are willing to help can remind you of your goal and help you find additional support.  If you are unsure about turning to your loved ones because you’ve let them down before, consider going to family therapy.</p> 
<p>Following are some tips on building your support systems:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Build a sober social network</strong> — If your previous social life revolved around alcohol, you may need to make some new connections. It’s important to have sober friends who will support your recovery. Try taking a class, joining a church or a civic group, volunteering, or attending events in your community. </li>
<li><strong>Consider moving in to a sober living home</strong> — Sober living homes provide a safe, supportive place to live while you’re recovering from alcohol addiction. They are a good option if you don’t have a stable home or an alcohol-free living environment to go to. </li>
<li><strong>Make meetings a priority</strong> — Join a recovery support group and attend meetings regularly. Spending time with people who understand exactly what you’re going through can be very healing. You can also benefit from the shared experiences of the group members and learn what others have done to stay sober.</li></ul>
