    <h4 class="h3">I will add fruit to my cereal or yogurt for breakfast</h4>

    Fresh, canned or dried, many fruits are excellent additions to typical breakfast items. Depending on the season, try some of these great ideas to increase the amount of fruit you eat every morning.

    Fresh Fruits

    Fresh fruits are sweet and filling. The meat and juices of fruit can help you feel full and energized well into the day.

        Apples
        Dice and add to oatmeal with cinnamon
        Berries
        Rinse and add to plain yogurt. The sweet berries and tangy yogurt make for a great breakfast or snack. You can also add crunch with dry cereal, nuts or seeds.
        Stone fruit
        Peaches and nectarines are delicious with cereal or whole grain waffles

    Canned Fruits

    Canned fruits are available year round and when you have stocked your pantry, they may help you eat fruits when fresh options are available or cost too much because they are out of season. Be sure to buy canned fruits in water. Syrups add a lot of unnecessary sugar to an already naturally sweet food.

        Like berries, pineapple is great with plain yogurt. Layer yogurt, pineapple and granola for a parfait.
        Add pears and berries to oatmeal, other cereal, or batters
        Make an English muffin breakfast pizza topped with light cream cheese and peaches

    Dried Fruits

    Dried fruits are packed with antioxidants! They also have more calories than fresh fruit. Add smaller amounts of dried fruits and nuts to your breakfast to avoid eating too many calories and fat.

        Cranberries or cherries in dry cereal- with or without milk
        Raisins in quick breads and granola
        Apricots in a breakfast trail mix of nuts, seeds and whole grain â€” eat alone or add to oatmeal
