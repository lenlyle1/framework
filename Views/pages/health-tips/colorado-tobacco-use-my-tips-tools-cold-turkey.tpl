<h1>I’ve tried going “cold turkey” several times and it does not work for me</h1>
<p>For some people, setting a quit date and going “cold turkey” works well, and for others, this is not an effective strategy. In fact, 95% of people who try to quit smoking without smoking cessation counseling or medication end up relapsing. The reason is because nicotine is so addicting and the brain becomes used to having it and craves more. Instead of going “cold turkey” consider talking to your doctor about smoking cessation options, or calling a free service such as QuitLine.</p>
