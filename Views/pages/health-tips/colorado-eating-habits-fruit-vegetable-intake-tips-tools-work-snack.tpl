    <h4 class="h3">I will take cut up veggies to work with me to snack on</h4>

    Being prepared is the best way to stay on track with a goal to take veggies to work to snack on:

        After you shop for the veggies you are going to pack with you to snack on, go home and right away wash and cut up what you are going to eat in the next few days.
        When preparing meals, set aside small portions of whatever vegetables you adding to or making for meals and packaging it for you snack.
        Use snack bags or small containers to create your own grab-and-go refrigerator stacked with snacks that you want to eat.
        If you have a refrigerator at work or where you are going, stock it for the week. Place the veggie snacks where you will see them each time you open the door!

    Snack Attack: Pack and go with one of these fun veggies!

        Slice 2-3 colors of bell peppers in strips and package to go. You can eat them plain or dip in hummus for a filling snack
        Crunchy radishes and cucumber spears taste great with avocado
        Jicama sticks sprinkled lime juice and dried chili pepper seasoning
        Carrot sticks and string cheese- easy!

    Eating a veggie snack helps you feel good about your choice and action

    You’ve eaten more veggies and done something good for yourself! If your goal is to eat a veggie for one snack each day for the next week, when you accomplish this goal, be sure to reward yourself (non-food of course!). Even adults respond well to rewards! When you meet your goal, consider rewarding yourself with:

        A new pair of walking or training shoes
        A book you want to read
        A bubble bath!
        15 minutes to yourself to do whatever you want
        Go to a movie
        Massage
        Manicure or pedicure — or both!
        A new outfit
