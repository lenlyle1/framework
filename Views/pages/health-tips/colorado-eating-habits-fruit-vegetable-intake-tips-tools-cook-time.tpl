    <h4 class="h3">I don’t know how to prepare fruits & vegetables in ways that my family and I will like</h4>

    Many people worry that they just don’t have the skills to prepare or choose more healthful foods. The good news is you don’t need new skills— you just need a few good Tips.

    Offer your family more raw fruits & vegetables.

    Here are some ways to sneak in more raw fruits & vegetables:

        Snack on raw vegetables or fruits instead of chips or pretzels. Keep sugar snap peas, raisins or carrot sticks in your car, your office or your backpack.
        Dried fruit is just as portable as potato chips — and less messy. It tastes especially good when added to basic trail mix.
        Try berries, melons or dates for a naturally sweet dessert rather than the usual candy bar, cookie, or ice cream sandwich.
        Combine fruit with your main meal courses. Raisins, apples and tangerine slices add sweet, crunchy variety to a salad. Apples complement pork, pineapple is great with fish, and orange slices are perfect with chicken.
        Eat a few “meal” salads, starting with greens and chopped vegetables as the base, but tossing in several ounces of cooked shrimp, turkey, low-fat cheese and/or legumes or chick peas.
