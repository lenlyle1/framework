<h1>I will join a support group for decreasing my alcohol intake</h1>
<p>This first step in decreasing your alcohol intake is to make an appointment with your healthcare provider to talk about your drinking.  You and your healthcare provider can make a plan for you either to stop or cut back on your drinking. Your health care provider will:</p>
<ul><li>Explain how much alcohol will be safe for you to drink</li>
<li>Ask if you have often been feeling sad or nervous</li>
<li>Help you figure out what else about your life may be causing you to drink too much</li>
<li>Tell you where you can get more support for cutting back or quitting alcohol</li></ul>
<p>When choosing a support group or treatment program, consider the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>There’s no magic bullet or single treatment that works for everyone</strong>. Everyone’s needs are different, so it’s important that you find a program that feels right to you. Any alcohol addiction treatment program should be customized to your unique problems and situation. </li>
<li><strong>Treatment should address more than just your alcohol abuse</strong>. Addiction affects your whole life, including your relationships, career, health, and psychological well-being. Treatment success depends on examining the way alcohol abuse has impacted you and developing a new way of living. </li>
<li><strong>Seek treatment for any other medical or psychological issues you’re experiencing</strong>. Alcohol abuse frequently goes hand in hand with other mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder, and bipolar disorder. In many cases, the drinking is an attempt to self-medicate. When these problems co-occur, recovery depends on treating them both.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment and follow-through are key</strong>. Recovering from alcohol addiction is not a quick and easy process. In general, the longer and more intense the alcohol use, the longer and more intense the treatment you’ll need. But regardless of the treatment program’s length in weeks or months, long-term follow-up care is crucial to recovery. </li>
<li><strong>There are many places to turn for help</strong>. Not everybody requires medically supervised detox or an extended stint in rehab. The level of care you need depends on your age, alcohol use history, and other medical or psychiatric conditions. In addition to doctors and psychologists, many clergy members, social workers, and counselors offer addiction treatment services.</li> </ul>

<h3>Support Groups:</h3>

<p><strong>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)</strong> is the most well-known and widely available self-help group for alcoholics in treatment and recovery. AA uses fellowship and a set of guided principles—the 12 steps—to help members achieve and maintain sobriety. The goal is total abstinence from drinking.</p>
<ul><li>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) <a href="http://www.aa.org">aa.org</a></li></ul>

<p><strong>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA)</strong> toll-free telephone number for alcohol and drug information/treatment referral assistance.</p>
<ul><li>Telephone: 1-800-662-HELP (4357)</li>
<li>When you call this toll-free number, a recorded message (English or Spanish language) gives you the following options:
<ol><li>Speak to a representative concerning substance abuse treatment or to request printed material on alcohol or drugs.</li>
<li>Local substance abuse treatment referral information in your state.</li></ol></li></ul>

<p><strong>Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS)</strong> is an international organization that takes a science-based, self-empowerment approach to abstinence and recovery from alcoholism.</p>
<ul><li>A network of independent meetings with an alternative recovery method </li>
<li>Promotes abstinence and provides support from others struggling with the same issues </li>
<li>Encourages self-empowerment approaches to recovery for those who are uncomfortable with the spiritual content of AA</li>
<li>Takes the approach that sobriety is a separate issue from religion or spirituality</li>
<li>Credits the individual for achieving and maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any Higher Power</li> </ul>
<p><strong>SMART Recovery (Self-Management and Recovery Training)</strong> is a program that aims for abstinence from alcohol or drugs through self-empowerment and self-directed change.</p>
<ul><li>Emphasizes self-empowerment, self-reliance, and self-directed change </li>
<li>Based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) </li>
<li>Teaches specific tools and techniques within a 4-point program: 
<ul><li>Enhancing and maintaining motivation to abstain </li>
<li>Coping with urges </li>
<li>Problem solving (managing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) </li>
<li>Lifestyle balance (balancing momentary and enduring satisfactions)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><strong>Women for Sobriety</strong>: Founded in 1976, Women for Sobriety (WFS) is the only national organization focusing specifically on the needs of alcoholic women, whose recovery in AA was found to be less successful than for men.</p>
<p>Women for Sobriety is based on the New Life Program, a series of 13 statements (such as: <em>I have a life-threatening problem that once had me. I now take charge of my life. I accept the responsibility. I am what I think. I am a capable, competent, caring, compassionate woman.</em>)</p>
<p>Premises and structure of WFS:</p>
<ul><li>The psychological needs of female alcoholics are different than for males</li>
<li>Weekly meetings in small groups of 6-10 women, with a structured format for confidential discussion</li>
<li>Based on thirteen positive statements to encourage emotional and spiritual growth, with emphasis on: 
<ul><li>Positive reinforcement (approval and encouragement)</li>
<li>Cognitive strategies (positive thinking)</li>
<li>Letting the body help (relaxation techniques, meditation, diet, and physical exercise)</li></ul></li></ul>
