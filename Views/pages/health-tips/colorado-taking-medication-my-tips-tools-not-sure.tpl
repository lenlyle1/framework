<h1>I think that I took my medications, but sometimes Iâ€™m not sure</h1>

    <p>Forgetting to take your medications is one thing; however, doubling the dosage because you forgot that you had already taken your medication may also put your health at risk. Placing your medications in a pill box where they are counted out for each day is a good way to remember if you have taken your daily dose. You can also have a checklist where you check off every time you take your medication.</p>
