    <h4 class="h3">I will reduce my intake of high fat snack foods</h4>

    <h5>Know which snack foods to reach for!</h5>
    <p>Snack foods that are high in fat are often times also high in calories. Common snack foods such as chips, cookies, ice cream, and candy are high-fat choices, and they are packed with calories as well. A good guide to follow when choosing snack foods:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Limit calories to around 100 per snack.</li>
        <li>Choose foods with high water or fiber content and fewer calories, such as carrots, grapes and air-popped popcorn, for your 100 calories.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead of high fat snacks, choose snacks from these food groups:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><b>Fruits & vegetables</b></p>
            <p>Eating fruits & vegetables provides a feeling of fullness and only a small number of calories. Fruits & vegetables also provide vitamins, minerals, fiber and other nutrients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Whole grains</b></p>
            <p>Whole-grain snacks are rich in fiber and complex carbohydrates, which give you energy with staying power. Look for items such as low-fat whole-grain crackers, whole-grain pretzels and whole-grain crisp breads.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Nuts and seeds</b></p>
            <p>Nuts and seeds provide protein, so you will feel fuller longer. They are high in fat, but it's mostly monounsaturated, a healthy kind of fat. Nuts and seeds are high in calories, however, so don't eat them in large quantities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Low-fat dairy products</b></p>
            <p>Cheese, yogurt and other dairy products are good sources of calcium and protein, plus many other vitamins and minerals. Choose the low-fat versions. Some yogurts have extra added sugar, so look for plain, low-calorie or "light" varieties.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Plan ahead to make better choices</h5>

    <p>With planning and a little preparation, you can have healthy foods on hand so that you're ready when temptation strikes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Prepare and pack healthy snacks at home for children and/or adults to eat at school or work.</li>
        <li>Have healthy snacks available at home and bring nutrient-dense snacks to eat when on the go.</li>
        <li>Before attending parties, eat a small, healthy snack at home. Then at the party take small portions and focus on healthy options.</li>
    </ul>
