<h1>“When I feel depressed, I get so focused on my problems and I don’t get out and interact with others”</h1>
<p>When you are feeling down, it can be easy to become consumed in your own thoughts and feelings. One strategy to help get through this is to volunteer your time at an organization. By helping other people going through hardships, you will be able to channel some of your sadness and inability to cope into ensuring that other people can. This removes the concentration from you to others, which can be good if you're prone to too much introspection.</p>
