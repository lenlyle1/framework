<h1>I’m so hungry when I get home in the evening that I eat everything that is not “nailed down”, and then I eat dinner</h1>
<p>For starters, try and prevent the “over-hungry” syndrome by planning a snack on your way home from work or school, such as an apple, string cheese and crackers, small bag of baked chips, or a small bag of pretzels. This should take the edge off your appetite. Consider having several healthful dinner options already made or recipes of quick and easy ones to make available so that you can eat soon after arriving home.</p>
