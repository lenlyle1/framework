<h1>I have the urge to drink but I am committed to cutting out alcohol</h1>

<p>Craving alcohol is a common symptom when trying to cut back or cut out drinking. Some ways to help &#8220;ride out the urge&#8221; are:</p> 
<ul><li>Talk to someone you trust, such as a friend or family member</li>
<li>Distract yourself until the urge passes: go for a walk, listen to music, or clean the house</li>
<li>Remind yourself your reasons for not drinking</li>
<li>Accept the urge instead of fighting it: This is known as &#8220;urge surfing.&#8221; Think of your craving as an ocean wave that will soon crest, break, and dissipate.</li></ul>
