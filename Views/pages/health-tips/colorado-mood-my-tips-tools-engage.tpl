<h1>I will engage in healthful behaviors that may help me manage my depression, such as healthful eating, getting enough sleep, and utilizing stress management techniques</h1>


<p>Your diet, sleep habits and stress coping skills are helpful in overcoming feelings of exhaustion, helplessness, and hopelessness. Setting healthful physical and emotional behavior goals are important to managing depression.</p>



<p><strong>Set realistic goals for yourself.</strong> Your mood may improve gradually, not immediately. Do not expect to suddenly "snap out of" your depression. Often during treatment for depression, sleep and appetite will begin to improve before your depressed mood lifts.</p>

<ul>
	<li>What goal(s) are reasonable for you at this time?</li>
	<li>Write them down and tell someone about your goal.</li>
	<li>Track and share your progress.</li>
	
</ul>


<p><strong>Try to be active and excercise.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Go to a movie, a ballgame, or another event or activity that you once enjoyed.</li>
	<li>Go for a walk. Indoors or outdoors, with a friend or without.</li>
	
</ul>

<p><strong>Eat nutritious foods.</strong> Knowing you are fueling your body properly and well can improve your mood.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Focus on foods that are not processed, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
	<li>Drink water throughout the day.</li>
	<li>See My Eating Habits section for more ideas and information.</li>
	
</ul>


<p><strong>Get 7-9 hours of sleep.</strong> Getting enough sleep is an important strategy for managing depression. Stick to one bed and wake time, every day.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Reduce screen time when you have a hard time falling asleep.</li>
	<li>Try reading or relaxation exercises to prepare for sleep.</li>
	
</ul>


<p><strong>Practice relaxation.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Breathing and muscle relaxation techniques guide your body from stressed states.</li>
	<li>See the <em>Managing My Stress</em> section for relaxation exercises.</li>
	
</ul>
