<h1>I will discuss any concerns I have about this medication with my health care team</h1>

    <p>Many people donâ€™t like to take medications on a daily basis, or they may have concerns about side effects of the medications they are taking. Talking to your doctor and healthcare team about your concerns is the first step.</p>

    <strong>Three questions to keep in mind when talking to your doctor are:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>What is my main problem?</li>
        <li>What do I need to do?</li>
        <li>Why is it important for me to do this?</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Have a discussion with your doctor about any and all drugs you are taking:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>What they do?</li>
		<li>How critical they are to your short- and long-term health?</li>
		<li>How to take them?</li>
		<li>Side effects they may cause?</li>
		<li>How to cope with any side effects?</li>
		<li>Are there any alternatives to taking the medication?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Depending on how many medications you have to discuss, you and your clinician may consider setting up an appointment devoted to understanding your medicines better. This is also an ideal time to talk about any concerns related to prohibitive costs of medicines as prescribed, or trouble taking your medicines as prescribed.</p>
    <p>In working with your doctor on treatment decisions and problem solving, you can more readily understand and carry out your responsibilities in the medication treatment plan.</p>
