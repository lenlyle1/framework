<h1>I will seek counseling to help me with managing my depression</h1>


<p>Talking to a professional therapist or counselor can be very helpful in managing depression. Through the process of sharing and listening, therapy can help you identify and overcome problems as well as discovering routes to positive changes in your life.</p>

<p>Professionals such as Psychologists (Ph.D. or Psy.D.), Social workers (LCSW, MSW), Marriage and Family Therapists (MFT) and Psychiatrists (M.D. or D.O.) are licensed to address mental health needs. In choosing a doctor or therapist to work with and what type of therapy is best for you, you may want to consider asking some of the following questions.</p>

<h2>Choosing a therapist</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Experience.</strong> Look for a therapist who is experienced in treating the problems that you have, such as depression.</li>
    
     <br>
    
	<li><strong>Seek Recommendations:</strong> ask a trusted person such as your physician or health care team, or a family member or friend, for a recommendation.</li>
    
    <br>
	<li><strong>Treatment types.</strong></li>
    
    <br>
    <strong>– Individual therapy. </strong>Individual therapy explores negative thoughts and feelings, as well as the harmful or self-destructive behaviors that might accompany them. Individual therapy may delve into the underlying causes of current problems (such as unhealthy relationship patterns or a traumatic experience from your past), but the primary focus is on making positive changes in the here and now.
    
    <br>
    <strong> – Family therapy.</strong> Family therapy involves treating more than one member of the family at the same time to help the family resolve conflicts and improve interaction. It is often based on the premise that families are a system. If one role in the family changes all are affected and need to change their behaviors as well. 
    
    <br>
    <strong>– Group therapy.</strong> Group therapy is facilitated by a professional therapist, and involves a group of peers working on the same problem, such as anxiety, depression or substance abuse, for example. Group therapy can be a valuable place to practice social dynamics in a safe environment and get inspiration and ideas from peers who are struggling with the same issues. <br>
    
    
    <strong>– Couples therapy (marriage counseling).</strong> Couples therapy involves the two people in a committed relationship. People go to couples therapy to learn how to work through their differences, communicate better and problem-solve challenges in the relationship.
    
    <br> <br>
    
    
    
<li><strong>Licensing.</strong> Make sure the therapist holds a current license and is in good standing with the state regulatory board.</li>
 <br>

<li><strong>Connection, safety and support.</strong> Ask yourself if you trust the person and feeling like they truly care.</li>


</ul>
