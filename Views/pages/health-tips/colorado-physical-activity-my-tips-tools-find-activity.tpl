<h1>I will find a type of physical activity I enjoy doing and work up to 30 minutes each day (walking, biking, swimming, skating, dancing, etc.)</h1>

	<p>Physical activity encompasses many types of movement - not just walking, jogging or biking! The key is to find an activity or several activities that you enjoy doing as you will be more likely to stick with it. First, think about your current fitness level, what types of physical activity would you like to try or do more of? Blending aerobic exercise and strengthening is best for your overall health. You can begin by walking and add strengthening when you are ready. Here are some examples of both types of activity:</p>

			<p><strong>Aerobic</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Walking, jogging or running</li>
				<li>Swimming laps</li>
				<li>Riding a bike</li>
				<li>Playing tennis</li>
				<li>Playing basketball</li>
				<li>Dancing</li>
				<li>Cross country skiing</li>
				<li>Aerobics</li>
				<li>Ski machines, stair climbers, steppers, and elliptical machines</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Strengthening</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lifting weights</li>
				<li>Working with resistance bands</li>
				<li>Doing exercises that use your body weight for resistance (i.e., push ups, sit ups)</li>
				<li>Heavy gardening (i.e., digging, shoveling)</li>
				<li>Yoga</li>
			</ul>

	<h3>Create a plan</h3>
	<p>Once you decide what activities you are going to do, secure the time on your calendar and begin to plan for necessary steps, like packing a bag with	walking shoes and an extra water bottle to take to work. If you can't fit in 30 minutes each time you exercise, breaking your active time into 10 minute increments is perfectly fine.</p>
	
	<h3>Do it with a buddy</h3>
	<p>Many people find it easier to both get started on a physical activity program, and to stick with one, if they do it with a family member or friend. Another strategy is to sign up for an exercise class at your local Y or recreation center.</p>

	<h3>Stick with it</h3>
	<p>By picking physical activities you enjoy and that match your abilities, it will help ensure that you stick with them. Remember your goal, record your activity and keep on moving!</p>

	<h3>Build up over time</h3>
	<p>If you want to do more vigorous-level activities, slowly replace those that take moderate effort like brisk walking, with more vigorous activities like jogging.</p>

	<h3>What if you have a disability?</h3>
	<p>If you are an adult with a disability, regular physical activity can provide you with important health benefits, like a stronger heart, lungs, and muscles, improved mental health, and a better ability to do everyday tasks. It's best to talk with your health care provider before you begin a physical activity	routine. Try to get advice from a professional with experience in physical activity and disability. They can tell you more about the amounts and types of physical activity that are appropriate for you and your abilities. If you are looking for additional information, visit The National Center on Physical Activity and Disability.</p>
