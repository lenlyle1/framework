<h1>I will decrease my alcohol intake by 1 drink each day</h1>
<p>Excessive alcohol intake is associated with several health problems and decreasing the amount of alcohol you consume is an important step in improving your overall health.  For some people, decreasing their drinking by cutting down slowly is an effective strategy.  Following are some tips for decreasing your alcohol intake:</p>

<h3>To begin decreasing your alcohol intake, first start by keeping track of how much you drink:</h3>

<ul><li>Find a way that works for you, such as a 3x5” card in your wallet, check marks on a kitchen calendar, or a personal digital assistant. If you make note of each drink before you drink it, this will help you slow down when needed. (Also, see trackers in the <em>Monitoring My Progress</em> section)</li>
<li>Watch your drinking patterns more closely and plan ahead. This can help you cut back on your alcohol use.</li>
<li>Once you have established your drinking patterns, set a goal of decreasing your alcohol by one drink each day. Use a tracking system like one described above to monitor your progress.</li></ul>

<h3>When you are drinking:</h3>

<ul><li>Pace yourself. Have no more than one alcoholic drink each hour. Sip on water, soda, or juice in between drinks with alcohol.</li>
<li>Eat some food before drinking and between drinks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Also consider:</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Avoid the things that trigger your urge to drink</strong>. If certain people, places, or activities trigger a craving for alcohol, try to avoid them. This may mean making major changes to your social life, such as finding new things to do with your old drinking buddies—or even giving up those friends. </li>
<li><strong>Practice saying “no” to alcohol in social situations</strong>. No matter how much you try to avoid alcohol, there will probably be times where you’re offered a drink. Prepare ahead for how you’ll respond, with a firm, yet polite, “no thanks”</li></ul>
