<h1>I will work with my doctor, dietitian, or healthcare team to set up a specific weight loss plan</h1>

    <p>Main Points: Specific components to ask your doctor to include in a weight loss plan (i.e. monitoring food and activity and follow up); what a dietitian is, benefits of working with a dietitian on weight loss, and how to find a dietitian in your area.</p>

    <p>Make your healthcare team aware of your weight loss goal and include them as part of your weight management team! They will support your decision to lose weight because achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar.</p>

    <p>A healthful weight loss plan involves components of learning, adapting and tracking for most of us.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Figuring out what foods and how much to eat</li>
        <li>Adapting to new foods or foods prepared a different way</li>
        <li>Tracking what works and what doesn’t</li>
        <li>Being physically active on most days of the week</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ask your doctor’s office for help in identifying tools and resources as well as following up with you after your visit. You may also ask for a referral to see a Registered Dietitian.</p>

    <h3>What Is an RD (or RDN)?</h3>
    <p>Registered dietitians and Registered Dietitian Nutritionists, or RDNs, are food and nutrition experts that know how a healthy diet improves health and fights disease. They can develop personalized nutrition plans and help you to separate facts from fads into information you can use. A registered dietitian can put you on the path to a healthy weight, eating healthfully and reducing your risk of chronic disease.</p>
    <p>A registered dietitian will partner with you to develop a safe, effective weight-loss plan that you can stick with for the long haul. To guide and motivate you, an RD will use creative and out-of-the-box strategies to help with meal planning, grocery shopping, food journaling and mindful eating.</p>
    <p>After learning about your health history, favorite foods, eating and exercise habits, an RD will help you set goals and prioritize. Follow-up visits will focus on maintenance and monitoring your progress.</p>
    <p>To locate a dietitian in your area, you may search a list maintained by the Academy of Dietetics and Nutrition at <a href="http://www.eatright.org/iframe/findrd.aspx" target="_blank">eatright.org/iframe/findrd.aspx</a>. This list will identify geographic areas and specialties as well.</p>
