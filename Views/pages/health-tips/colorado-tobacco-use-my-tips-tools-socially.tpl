<h1>I like to have a cigarette when I go out socially with my family and friends</h1>
<p>Certain activities may trigger your urge to smoke. Social situations, particularly ones that involve alcohol, are the most common triggers, so try to drink less when you first quit smoking. If coffee is a trigger, try switching to tea for a few weeks. If you usually smoke after meals, find something else to do, like going for a walk, brushing your teeth, or chewing gum.</p>
