            <p><b>About 480 calories and 50 grams of carbohydrate</b></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Slow-cooker recipes:</b></p>
            <p>If you have a slow cooker (also called a crockpot), search for healthy soup, stew, or chili recipes. Throw the ingredients in at the beginning of the day, let it cook for several hours, and enjoy at dinner time with minimal work!</p>
            <p><b>Calories and grams of carbohydrate per serving will depend on the recipe you choose. Look for recipes that include the nutrition information.</b></p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>If you are at a fast food restaurant here are some suggestions when deciding what to order:</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>Order the smallest sandwich on the menu.</li>
        <li>Ask for the grilled chicken instead of fried chicken in sandwiches, wraps, and salads.</li>
        <li>Ask for sandwiches without mayonnaise, sauces, and cheese. Opt for low-fat or low-calorie sauces and dressings. Some good condiment options are mustard, fat-free salad dressing, salsa, or barbeque sauce.</li>
        <li>If you order French fries, split an order with friends. Keep portions small and consider fries a “treat.”</li>
        <li>Choose sugar-free drinks such as water, unsweetened tea, coffee, or diet fountain drinks.</li>
        <li>Main course salads are another option at fast food places. Be careful though, sometimes salads with a lot of high-fat meats and cheese actually have more calories than a cheeseburger. Also, dressing packets are often large. When it comes to salad dressing, a little can go a long way so use the smallest amount possible.</li>
        <li>Choose lean meats for subs or a veggie sub. Try the turkey or grilled chicken breast sub instead of a meatball sub.</li>
    </ul>
