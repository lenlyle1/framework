<h1>The weather makes it difficult to exercise</h1>
	<h3>Try Mall walking</h3>
	<p>Walking in a mall (or a church or YMCA gym) offers a secure environment where you can exercise on your own or meet up with friends.</p>

	<h3>Walk the halls or climb the stairs</h3>
	<p>If you live or work in a high-rise building, you can use the stairs as a free “StairMaster.”</p>

	<h3>Borrow, rent, or buy workout videos and DVDs</h3>
	<p>You can find just about anything from Pilates to strength training to fun aerobic dance workouts. </p>

	<h3>Vacuum, dust, and sweep to stay active, and keep your home or office tidy</h3>

	<h3>Set up a home gym</h3>
	<p>Set up a home gym with a stationary bicycle or treadmill, free weights, resistance bands, and stability ball. Check out used equipment to save money.</p>

	<h3>Make the weather part of the experience</h3>
	<p>If hot and sunny, wear your hat and sunscreen. If cold, dress in layers and enjoy the briskness. Always carry water and drink in both hot and cold weather.</p>
