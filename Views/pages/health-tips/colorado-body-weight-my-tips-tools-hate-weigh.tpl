<h1>I hate to weigh myself and I want to throw out my home scale</h1>
<p>Many people get discouraged when they weigh themselves, particularly if they are not meeting their weight management goals. However, people who regularly weigh themselves (once or twice each week) are more successful at achieving weight loss and then maintaining their weight. Plan one or two consistent days each week that you will weigh yourself and do it at the same time each day. For example, choose to weigh yourself every Monday and Thursday first thing in the morning when you get up.<p>
