<h1>Iâ€™m on a tight deadline at work and I get called into another meeting, and I need to pick up my child from daycare by 5pm!</h1>
<p>First, breathe! Taking a deep breath and breathing from your diaphragm oxygenates your blood, which can help you feel more relaxed instantly! Once you have taken several deep, relaxing breaths, talk to your co-workers to see if someone can help you with your deadline while you are in the meeting. Talk to your spouse, another family member or trusted friend to see if he or she can pick up your child. And schedule some time for yourself to relax once you have met your work deadline!</p>
