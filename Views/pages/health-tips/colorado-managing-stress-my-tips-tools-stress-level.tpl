<p>Stress surfaces in different ways.  The key is to identify how you react to stress.  Here are a few signs that may indicate stress for you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lack of concentrate</li>
            <li>Irritability or short temper</li>
            <li>Feeling overwhelmed </li>
            <li>Depression or general unhappiness</li>
            <li>Aches and pains</li>
            <li>Diarrhea, constipation or nausea</li>
            <li>Eating more or less </li>
       
            <li>Sleeping too much or too little</li>
            <li>Isolating yourself from others</li>
            <li>Procrastinating or neglecting responsibilities </li>
            <li>Using alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs to relax</li>
        </ul>
<p>Once you recognize stress, think through whether or not one of these options may help alleviate some of the stress you feel. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sit with warm cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Play with a pet. </li>
            <li>Work in your garden. </li>
            <li>Get a massage.</li>
            <li>Read a good book. </li>
            <li>Listen to music.</li>
            <li>Go for a walk or run. </li>
      
            <li>Spend time in nature.</li>
            <li>Laugh with a family member or friend. </li>
            <li>Work up a sweat by lifting weights. </li>
            <li>Write about how feel.</li>
            <li>Take a long bath.</li>
        </ul>

<p>The goal is to relieve the feeling of stress and walk away feeling better.  Use positive actions for yourself to reduce stress.  For example, reciting positive affirmations can be helpful to reprogram your unconscious mind from negative thoughts to positive ones.  Some examples of positive affirmations include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>All is well in my life</li>
    <li>I am healthy and whole</li>
    <li>I am giving and grateful</li>
    <li>I focus my energy on moving forward</li>
</ul>
